## About the Book
Neural Network Computer Vision with OpenCV equips you with professional skills and knowledge to build intelligent vision systems using OpenCV. It creates a sequential pathway for understanding morphological operations, edge and corner detection, object localization, image classification, segmentation, and advanced applications like face detection and recognition, and optical character recognition. 

This book offers a practical roadmap to explore the nuances of image processing with detailed discussions on each topic, supported by hands-on Python code examples. The readers will learn the basics of neural networks, deep learning and CNNs by using deep learning frameworks like Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch, Caffe etc. They will be able to utilize OpenCV DNN module to classify images by using  models like Inception V3, Resnet 101, Mobilenet V2. Moreover, the book will help to successfully Implement object detection using YOLOv3, SSD and R-CNN models. The character detection and recognition models are also covered in depth with code examples.

You will gain a deeper understanding of how these techniques impact real-world scenarios and learn to harness the potential of Python and OpenCV to solve complex problems. Whether you are building intelligent systems, automating processes, or working on image-related projects, this book equips you with the skills to revolutionize your approach to visual data.
